      "description": "This is the most popular Portuguese white wine, which has won the hearts of consumers all over the world. Vinho Verde is not only the name of the wine, but also the region with a wide range of wines. A white bestseller of the most popular style, a light, drinkable, fruity and slightly sparkling wine. On the palate, hints of tropical fruit and citrus are perfectly complemented by balanced acidity and a slight presence of residual sugar. Unobtrusive and versatile, wonderfully chilled as an aperitif.Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
